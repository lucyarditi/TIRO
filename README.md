# TIRO

## Overview

The TIRO code performs numerical integration for the construction of dynamical models of tidally perturbed rotating stellar systems. It is the implementation of the paper:


Python3 is required, as are the sys, math, numpy and scipy packages.

## Inputs

The required inputs for integration and constructing the internal solution are the concentration, tidal strength and asynchronicity parameters, the galactic potential coefficient, and the polar and
